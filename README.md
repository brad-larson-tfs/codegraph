Program Generation from Graph and LLM search

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating code.  However, they are less capable of creating and working within complete programs.  Earlier work in code generation focused on graph-based code generation using abstract syntax trees and other meta-modals.  With the rapid advances in LLMs, this approach has been largely abandoned in favor of next-word completion within the context of the current program code and supporting documents (cite copilot, ...).  
    - Code fails to execute, 
    - Code does not perform desired function,
    - Reasoning fails to perform complex tasks,
    - Reasoning fails to perform simple tasks,
    - Does not account for changes that impact other parts of the program

Experiment: Interesting, easy to explain, scalable for experiment. 
Code complexity: 

    - Cyclomatic complexity,

Possible applications:
- Calculator (1),  
- web store, 
- chatbot, 
- voice assistant (2), 
- social media, 
- Web encyclopedia,
- Web search,
- web browser (3),
- game,  

Methods of code generation:
- LLMs: next-word completion,
- Retrieval:
- Graph: generate graph, progressively implement and refine graph
- Agent: generate code, progressively implement and refine code
- Reasoning models:

## Literature survey:
- What is the current state of code generation
- What is program synthesis
- How is this different from code generation
- How are are generated programs tested and validated
- How is code complexity measured
- Is cyclomatic complexity a good measure of code complexity
- How will we measure cyclomatic complexity in this project
- How do we perform LLM code generation
- How do we perform LLM code generation with Retrieval
- How do we perform LLM code generation with Graphs
- How do we perform LLM code generation with Agents
- How do we perform LLM code generation with Reasoning models

Process of Literature Survey:
1. Form questions
1. Search for papers (scholar.google.com, arxiv, etc.)
1. Interview papers
1. Summarize papers
1. Include into literature survey
