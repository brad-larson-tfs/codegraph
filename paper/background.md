# Background

## Current State of Code Generation with Large Language Models

According to a comprehensive survey by Jiang et al.[^1], the field of code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) has seen significant advancement and transformation. Here's an overview of the current state:

### Architecture and Model Types

Code LLMs can be categorized into three main architectural types:
1. **Encoder-only models** (e.g., CodeBERT) - Specialized for code understanding tasks like type prediction and code retrieval
2. **Decoder-only models** (e.g., StarCoder) - Excel at generation tasks including code generation and translation
3. **Encoder-decoder models** (e.g., CodeT5) - Versatile models that can handle both understanding and generation

### Training Process

The development of code LLMs typically follows a multi-stage process:
1. Pre-training on large-scale code corpora
2. Continued pre-training on general LLMs (optional)
3. Fine-tuning with instruction data
4. Reinforcement learning with various forms of feedback (optional)

### Data Sources

Code LLMs are trained on diverse data sources including:
- GitHub repositories (filtered by stars/forks for quality)
- Stack Overflow (using vote counts as quality metrics)
- Synthetic data (increasingly being incorporated)
- A mix of code, text, and mathematical content

### Recent Advances

Key developments in the field include:
- Repository-level code generation
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Development of autonomous coding agents
- Integration with development environments (e.g., GitHub Copilot)

### Major Players

Several significant code LLMs have emerged:
- Code Llama (Meta AI)
- DeepSeek Coder (DeepSeek)
- Code Qwen
- WizardCoder (Microsoft)
- Code Gemma (Google)
- StarCoder
- OctoCoder
- CodeGen

### Evaluation Methods

Code LLMs are evaluated using various benchmarks:
- HumanEval
- MBPP
- BigCodeBench (for more practical and challenging tasks)

### Current Challenges

The field faces several important challenges:
1. Data quality and privacy concerns
2. Ethical implications
3. Environmental impact
4. Need for responsible and efficient deployment
5. Ensuring code safety and trustworthiness

### Future Directions

The field is moving towards:
- More efficient and environmentally conscious models
- Better integration with development workflows
- Enhanced code understanding and generation capabilities
- Improved safety and reliability measures

## Code Generation Quality

According to Jiang et al.[^1], the quality of code generation is addressed through multiple dimensions:

### Data Quality Control
- High-quality training data is filtered using metrics such as:
  - GitHub repository stars and forks
  - Stack Overflow vote counts
  - Permissive licensing
- Data preprocessing includes:
  - Removal of duplicated and noisy data
  - Elimination of privacy-sensitive information
  - Filtering for code quality metrics

### Quality Assurance Methods
1. **Pre-training Quality**
   - Specialized pre-training on code-specific corpora
   - Incorporation of both code and natural language understanding
   - Use of synthetic data to enhance quality and coverage

2. **Fine-tuning and Instruction**
   - Instruction tuning with high-quality examples
   - Reinforcement learning with various forms of feedback
   - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Functional correctness testing
   - Code similarity measures
   - Real-world task completion
   - Assessment through benchmarks like HumanEval and BigCodeBench

### Quality Enhancement Techniques
- Repository-level context consideration
- Retrieval-augmented generation for improved accuracy
- Integration of development environment feedback
- Autonomous testing and validation
- Code safety and trustworthiness verification

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular model updates with new high-quality data
- Integration of user feedback
- Adaptation to emerging programming paradigms
- Focus on code maintainability and readability
- Emphasis on ethical considerations and environmental impact

The paper emphasizes that code quality is not just about functional correctness but encompasses broader aspects including maintainability, readability, and ethical considerations in the generation process.
