\caption{\done{
The applications of code LLMs in various code-related understanding and generation tasks. 
The I-O column indicates the type of input and output for each task, where C, NL, and K represent code, natural language, and label, respectively. 
Note that the detailed definitions of each task aligns with the descriptions in \cite{ahmad2021unified,austin2021program,niu2022deep,athiwaratkun2022multi,zan2023large}. 
The main scope of this survey focuses on code generation while it may involve code completion in Section \ref{sec:repository_level} and \ref{sec:retrieval_augmented}, aiming to illustrate the corresponding advancements.
% To enhance clarity, it might be beneficial for the paper to explicitly differentiate between these tasks and provide a more nuanced definition that acknowledges the varied applications of LLMs in code-related tasks.
