\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this survey, we provide a systematic literature review, serving as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. A thorough introduction and analysis for data curation, the latest advances, performance evaluation, \done{ethical implications, environmental impact,} and real-world applications are illustrated.  
In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation in recent years and offer an empirical comparison using the widely recognized \done{HumanEval, MBPP, and the more practical and challenging BigCodeBench benchmarks} to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. 
Critical challenges and promising opportunities regarding the gap between academia and practical development are also identified for future investigation. 
Furthermore, we have established a dedicated resource website to continuously document and disseminate the most recent advances in the field.
We hope this survey can contribute to a comprehensive and systematic overview of LLM for code generation and promote its thriving evolution. 
We optimistically believe that LLM will ultimately change all aspects of coding and automatically write safe, helpful, accurate, trustworthy, and controllable code, like professional programmers, and even solve coding problems that currently cannot be solved by humans.
