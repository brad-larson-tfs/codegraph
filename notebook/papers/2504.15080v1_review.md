## Q&A


1. Summarize the process described in this paper:
   - The paper introduces DLCodeGen, a planning-guided method for generating deep learning projects using LLMs. The process consists of three main stages: (1) predicting a structured solution plan from user requirements using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model, (2) retrieving semantically similar code samples and abstracting a code template (using Code RAG and Template RAG), and (3) synthesizing the final code via a comparative learning mechanism that integrates both retrieved code and templates. (Section: III.A, Page: 4, Citation: "the pipeline of DLCodeGen consists of three key stages. First, a GPT-2 model is fine-tuned to predict a solution plan... Second, the generated plan is leveraged to retrieve semantically analogous code samples (Code RAG) and subsequently abstract a code template (Template RAG)... Third, a comparative learning mechanism is designed to synthesize the final code through the integration of Code RAG and Template RAG...")

   - A detailed description of a solution plan is:
     - A solution plan in DLCodeGen is a structured blueprint that guides the generation of deep learning projects. It consists of four core components:
       1. **Task Category**: Specifies the primary type of machine learning task (e.g., Image Classification, Text Generation, Object Detection). (Section: III.B, Page: 4, Citation: "1) Task Category: Identifies the primary type of machine learning task, such as Image Classification, Text Generation, or Object Detection.")
       2. **Dataset**: Describes the input and output data specifications, including dimensionalities, formats, and relevant attributes. (Section: III.B, Page: 4, Citation: "2) Dataset: Describes the specifications of both input and output data, including their dimensionalities, formats, and other relevant attributes.")
       3. **Preprocess**: Outlines the sequence of data transformations needed to prepare raw data for model input, such as normalization, feature extraction, and dataset partitioning. (Section: III.B, Page: 4-5, Citation: "3) Preprocess: Outlines the sequence of transformations necessary to convert raw data into a format suitable for model input, including operations such as normalization, feature extraction, and the partitioning of datasets into training, validation, and test sets.")
       4. **Model Architecture**: Details the structure of the model, including layer composition, connectivity, and hyperparameter settings (e.g., optimizer, loss function, learning rate, batch size, epochs, evaluation metric). (Section: III.B, Page: 5, Citation: "4) Model Architecture: Specifies the structural configuration of the model, including layer compositions, connectivity patterns, and the initialization and optimization of hyperparameters.")
     - An example solution plan for an image classification task includes: normalizing input images, partitioning the dataset, defining a multi-layer model architecture, and specifying optimization and evaluation strategies. (Section: III.B, Page: 5, Citation: "Figure 2 presents an illustrative example of a solution plan for an image classification task. Initially, all input images are normalized... followed by dataset partitioning... The proposed model architecture consists of six layers, optimized using the Adam optimization algorithm in conjunction with the cross-entropy loss function...")


1. How does this paper address code generation?
   - The paper addresses code generation by providing global guidance through a solution plan, which structures the generation process and ensures coherence. It augments LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategies, using both concrete code samples and abstracted templates, and combines their strengths through comparative learning to produce robust, domain-aligned code. (Section: III, Page: 4-6, Citation: "DLCodeGen employs a fine-tuned model to predict a structured solution plan, offering global guidance for LLMs to generate comprehensive and coherent deep learning projects... To further improve the quality of the generated code, we implement two RAG strategies, namely Code RAG and Template RAG... These results are then integrated through a comparative learning mechanism...")


1. What are the claims of this paper with respect to code generation?
   - The authors claim that DLCodeGen outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating deep learning projects, achieving higher scores in both automatic (CodeBLEU) and human evaluation metrics (compliance, usefulness, idiomaticity). They argue that planning-guided generation, template abstraction, and comparative learning collectively improve code quality, coherence, and domain alignment. (Section: V, Page: 10, Citation: "DLCodeGen consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in deep learning project generation across all backbone LLMs, as demonstrated by higher scores in both the overall CodeBLEU metric and its four sub-metrics.") (Section: V.B, Page: 11, Citation: "DLCodeGen demonstrates significant improvements of 7.8% and 5.6% in compliance and idiomaticity, respectively, while achieving comparable performance in helpfulness when compared to the strong baseline, CEDAR.")


1. How is the LLM context used?
   - LLM context is enriched by incorporating structured solution plans, retrieved code samples, and abstracted templates into the prompt. This multi-source context provides both high-level architectural guidance and fine-grained implementation details, helping the LLM generate code that is both practical and idiomatic. (Section: III.C-D, Page: 5-6, Citation: "The generated solution plans play a pivotal role in guiding LLMs to generate deep learning projects. To maximize their utility, we employ these plans as foundational prompts and further enrich the LLMâ€™s input through the retrieval of similar code and the abstraction of high-level templates, i.e., Code RAG and Template RAG.")


1. How is code retrieval performed?
   - Code retrieval is performed in two stages: (1) narrowing the search scope based on the task category in the solution plan, and (2) using the BM25 algorithm to match the solution plan against a pool of code samples. The top-ranked samples are used for further template abstraction and as references for code generation. (Section: III.C, Page: 5, Citation: "The retrieval process is conducted in two stages: first, the search scope is narrowed based on the task type specified in the solution plan; second, semantically relevant code samples are identified through similarity matching between solution plans using the BM25 algorithm.")


1. What is the code generation process?
   - The process starts with generating a solution plan, retrieving and abstracting code, and then prompting the LLM to generate two code outputs (one from Code RAG, one from Template RAG). A comparative learning mechanism then guides the LLM to synthesize the final code by selecting optimal segments from both outputs, ensuring the result is robust, coherent, and aligned with user requirements. (Section: III.D, Page: 6, Citation: "Guided by the solution plan, DLCodeGen utilizes a comparative learning mechanism to integrate the outputs of Code RAG and Template RAG, directing LLMs to generate the final code... The LLM is guided to compare the two provided deep learning code outputs by utilizing the comprehensive insights from the solution plan, and subsequently identifies the optimal segments from each to inform the synthesis of the final deep learning project.")
